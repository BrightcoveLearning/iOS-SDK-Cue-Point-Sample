@interface AVPlayer (BCOVSignalSupport)

/**
 * Returns a signal which sends a CMTime wrapped in an NSValue at the interval
 * specified. Values are also sent whenever time jumps and whenever playback
 * starts or stops, just like -addPeriodicTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock:.
 * That method's caveats regarding scheduling very short intervals apply to
 * this as well. The returned signal never completes; you must explicitly
 * dispose of the subscription to allow this AVPlayer to become released.
 *
 * The returned signal does not guarantee which thread its events will be
 * delivered on, so it is important to use -[RACSignal deliverOn:RACScheduler.mainThreadScheduler]
 * to force events to be sent on the main thread if main thread execution is
 * required by subscribers. (A private serial queue is created for the periodic
 * observer.)
 *
 * Note: the periodic time observer will be added (and removed) on the main
 * thread, regardless of which thread this method is called from, as is required
 * by AVFoundation.
 *
 * Note: Adding the periodic observer while content is playing appears to cause
 * nondeterministic crashes due to a bug in AVFoundation.
 *
 * Note: The -addPeriodicTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock: method will
 * create a strong reference to this AVPlayer instance, preventing it from being
 * released. To allow this AVPlayer to become released, you must explicitly
 * dispose of the returned signal.
 *
 * @param interval The interval at which events should be sent to subscribers
 * during normal playback.
 * @return A signal which sends values according to the specified interval.
 * The value sent is the current time of the player as a CMTime wrapped in an
 * NSValue.
